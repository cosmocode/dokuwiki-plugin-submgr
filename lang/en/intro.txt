====== Automatic Subscription Management ======

This tool allows you to define rules for automatically adding email subscriptions for users and groups. When a new
rule is added, it is automatically applied to all matching users (eg. they are subscribed to the given page or
namespace immeadiately). All existing rules are automatically applied to all newly created users.
